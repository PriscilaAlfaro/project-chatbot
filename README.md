# Week 4-Technigo Bootcamp

# Project Chatbot
The aim with this project was to create a chatbot by working in pairs, ie through pair programming.

## The problem

We first discussed and decided on what the chatbot should chat about. We wanted to make a bot that sold something we both lack - more time. First thing we did was to write the script, what the bot would say and what options to present.
We worked together in VS code live share, and the one of us being more proficient at JS solved some bugs on her own. 
If we had more time we would make the bot have a more complex decision tree and maybe try to style it different.
